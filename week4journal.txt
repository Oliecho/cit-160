This week we got into using JavaScript together with HTML to write some standalone programs. We learned how to get input from the user in a variety of ways, basic methods of processing the information, and how to output back the result into the HTML page. We started working with code by editing some of the examples from the course content.
The peer review I got this week was less than desirable, the classmate that reviewed my code simply said that it looked good, and then asked me if it validated. In my opinion, you can’t really review another person’s code properly without at least validating it yourself. A better peer review would include both a W3C validation, and a trial run to see how it actually works. But I guess not everyone is as thorough as I like to be. Overall, this week has been great, and I’m excited to learn more next week!
