This week, we learned about control structures such as "if", "else" and "case". These are selection control structures, in that they instruct the computer to choose to run some code, and skip other code, depending on the results of predefined criteria. I had a challenge finding the code I needed to successfully to the debugging quiz, but I did the best with what I had.
I received some helpful peer review this week. One of my classmates praised the readability of my code, and thanked me for using easy to read variable names and descriptive comments throughout. Another classmate said that my code was going to get me a good grade, but that I could provide more instructions to the user to help them understand how my code works. Both of these replies helped me see how to improve my code in the future.
Thank you for your help and support as I learn in this class.
