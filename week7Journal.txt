This week, I learned how to write "if" statements using logical operators. The logical operators are as follows: Not, And, Or, and Xor. They are processed in this order as well, similar to how order of operations work in arithmetic. To find which logical operators are equivalent, I can use a truth table. A truth table lists all of the possible combinations of the different conditions in play, and then shows the outcomes as they are compared. This can help me simplify my logical expressions.

This week, I got some positive feedback from one of my classmates in the peer review discussion board. He pointed out that my solution was much simpler than the one he had come up with. In the end though, I had to add a bit of complexity into my final draft so that the auto grader would read the code properly. Overall, this week has been good, and I feel excited to learn more next week!
