This week, I learned about repetition in JavaScript programs. Repetition is accomplished by using control structures called loops. Loops can be any combination of pre- or post-test, and counting or sentinel. All loops in JavaScript are pre-test, except for the "do while" loop. "for", "while", and "for-each" loops are pre-test. Pre-test means that the logic that determines if the loop will execute is evaluated before the code in the loop is run. If the logic evaluates as false, the code in the loop is skipped, and never runs. On the other hand, a post-test loop will always run the code in the loop at least once, because the logic in the loop is only evaluated at the bottom of the loop, basically telling the computer to go back to the "do" statement.

In the peer review activity, my classmate said that my "code seems to work" and asked if I was having any trouble with it.
